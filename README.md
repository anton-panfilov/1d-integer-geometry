# 1D Integer Geometry Library Documentation

Welcome to the 1D Geometry Library, a comprehensive PHP library designed for handling 1D geometric shapes like points, segments, and vectors. This library offers functionality to manipulate these shapes, determine intersections, and perform sorting operations based on various criteria.

## Features

- **Exclusion Operations**: Perform exclusion operations between points, segments, and vectors, and analyze the resulting shapes.
- **Intersection Detection**: Determine whether various 1D geometric shapes intersect with each other.
- **Sorting Capabilities**: Sort collections of geometric shapes based on minimum values, lengths, and other criteria.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 1D Geometry Library, ensure you have PHP installed and your environment is set up to run PHP scripts. Clone this repository to your local machine and include the necessary files in your PHP project.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available for each major component of the library:

- [Exclusion Operations](docs/Exclude.md): Learn how to use the `Exclude` class to perform exclusion operations between geometric shapes.
- [Intersection Detection](docs/Intersects.md): Understand the capabilities of the `Intersects` class for determining intersections between shapes.
- [Sorting Capabilities](docs/Sort.md): Explore the `Sort` class to sort geometric shapes based on various criteria.

## Examples

For practical examples and usage, refer to the individual documentation files linked above. Each file includes examples demonstrating how to use the library's features.
